# HTML-And-CSS-Assignment

Assessment Review for JS section:

- Added the scroll bar for the page when the side menu is displayed.
- Fixed all console errors.
- Fixed all HTML errors using the W3C HTML Validator extension.
- Fixed sticky header's nav buttons scrolling the page to the top when clicked.
- Fixed cookie not displaying on refresh:
    - Orginally the cookie had a duration of 1 minute. I've upped it to 1 day.
    - If running locally without a localhost server or webserver, document.cookie doesn't work with Chrome / Edge security protocols (it does work with Firefox).
